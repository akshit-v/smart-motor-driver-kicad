Smart Motor Driver – Kicad

This repository contains the complete design and documentation for a smart motor driver capable of driving two high-current DC motors (up to 60V, 40A each) with real-time voltage and current sensing. The driver is built using discrete components, and gate drivers for H-bridge MOSFET control. It is designed for high-efficiency operation, integrated protection, and microcontroller-based control.

The project includes the full schematic, PCB layout, firmware interface, and performance analysis. It is intended for embedded system applications such as robotics, automation, and motorized systems requiring efficient and protected motor drive control.
